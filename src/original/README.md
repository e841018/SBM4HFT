### Interface

The interface of `exch()` is designed to be compatible with the `PricingEngine` IP in Xilinx MarketMaker PoC platform.

### Algorithm

The Simulated Bifurcation (SB) algorithm is implemented based on the following papers.

* “Combinatorial optimization by simulating adiabatic bifurcations in nonlinear Hamiltonian systems,” Science Advances 2019
  * Proposed SB
* “FPGA-based Simulated Bifurcation Machine,” FPL2019
  * Benchmarked SA, CIM, GPU-based SB and FPGA-based SB
* “A Currency Arbitrage Machine Based on the Simulated Bifurcation Algorithm for Ultrafast Detection of Optimal Opportunity.” ISCAS2020
  * SB-based arbitrage machine
